# Auto-ML-using-Lazy-Predict

Lazy Predict help build a lot of basic models without much code and helps understand which models works better without any parameter tuning.

Lazypredict is an open-source python package created by <b>Shankar Rao Pandala</b>. Development and contribution to this are still going. 



Properties of LazyPredict:

- As of now, it is only based on <b>Supervised learning algorithms</b>(Regression and Classification)
- Compatible with python version <b>3.6 and above</b>.
- Could be run on Command Line Interface(CLI). 
- Fast in predicting as all the basic model performances for the dataset is given at once.
- Has an <b>inbuilt Pipeline</b> to <b>scaling</b> and <b>transform</b> the data and handle missing values and change categorical data to numeric. 
- Provides <b>evaluation metrics</b> on individual models.
- Shows the <b>time consumed</b> by each model to build.
